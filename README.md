*Build teams and systems that don’t need me in every room.*

I started as a solo systems administrator and never stopped expanding the blast radius. I’ve gone deep in networking, large-scale SRE, security engineering, and data infrastructure. I’m still hands-on in all of it, one way or another. I’ll also build frontends when needed, using whatever makes sense at the time.

Some people watch me use AI tools and call it vibe coding. I call it over a decade of instinct making sure the first version ships miles ahead of everyone else’s third.

### The Short Version

I came up through networking and systems administration, got into Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) at **LinkedIn** running Hadoop infrastructure across 10,000+ physical servers and multiple datacenters, then founded the security engineering team at **CircleCI** after working my way up from Staff SRE to founding the macOS Team. Data infrastructure has been the constant thread through all of it. Big data pipelines, observability stacks, metrics systems — name it and I’ve probably touched it.

I’m currently **Head of Engineering at [VoiceBrain AI](https://www.voicebrain.ai)**, leading across product, platform, SRE, and DevOps. Shipping AI products, staying hands-on in architecture and code, and building the kind of team that doesn’t need me to be in every room.

I’ve been the person getting paged at 2 AM, the person building the observability stack so *nobody* gets paged at 2 AM, and the person who ships a frontend on the weekend because the existing one wasn’t good enough. I don’t draw lines between “backend” and “frontend.” I draw a line between *shipped* and *didn’t ship*.

### How I Lead

Leadership shouldn’t be implicit or guesswork. How I lead, what I expect, and how decisions get made are documented and public:

### AI-Assisted Development

Yes, I use Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and whatever else sharpens the edge. I’m not generating code and hoping it works. I’m generating code and *knowing* where it will break, then fixing it before it does. That’s what experience buys you: the instinct to ship fast and the judgment to ship correctly.

In other words, I understand what's being generated before shipping it to the world.

### When I’m Not Engineering

- &#9749; Drinks too much coffee. Sleeps mostly fine anyway.
- &#128218; Reads books about behavior and decision-making
- &#127794; Long walks in the woods — thinking optional
- &#127925; Listens to what the kids call “dreampop” and is, in fact, that cool
- &#127968; Madison, WI
